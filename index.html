# Smaller Defined Spatial Unit Example ------------------------------------

### Here is a small example to show how to pull out the Census Tracts for a specific MSA (the 6 county Detroit MSA)
# First we define a new dataframe.  Since it isn't all US counties, we call it DetroitMSACT
# You should notice some other differences in the code
# The geography was changed from "county" to "tract" because we want the smaller spatial unit
# variables, Survey, Year, Output stay the same (it will bring back same variables from same year in the same way)
# The state="" is new and here you could define the state.  We want the Detriot MSA so its only "MI", but if you wanted to add more, you could with state=c("MI", "OH", ...)
# The county= argument is also new.  here you can define the specific counties you would want to pull.  the c("county1name", "county2name", etc) comes from the MSA counties for 
DetroitMSACT<-get_acs(geography = "tract",  #Defining the spatial scale
                variables = Variables, #grabbing the variables we defined previously
                survey = "acs5",      # survey we are pulling is the ACS 5 year estimates
                year = 2020,   # End year for the 5 year estimates- 2016-2020
                output = "wide", # data format wide (cross sectional)
                state="MI", # Define which State you want to pull data from
                county= c("Wayne","Oakland", "Macomb", "Livingston", "St. Clair", "Lapeer"), # Defining the counties in the state that the data will come from
                geometry=T) # Pulls the spatial data information with it.


# First 10 records/observations return
head(DetroitMSACT)

# summary() provides an overview of the data
summary(DetroitMSACT)

# Lets clean up this data a little bit before we go too far
# Here we are just pulling out the columns we care about using the indexing dataframe[,c("column name","etc")]
Detroit<-DetroitMSACT[,c("GEOID", "NAME", "MHIE", "MHVE", "TotalpopE", "geometry")]
# Easy renaming of the variables
names(Detroit)[names(Detroit) =="MHIE"]<-"MHI"
names(Detroit)[names(Detroit) =="MHVE"]<-"MHV"
names(Detroit)[names(Detroit) =="TotalpopE"]<-"Totalpop"


### Setting up the color palletes
DpalMHI<-colorQuantile(palette = "viridis", domain=Detroit$MHI, n=10)
DpalMHV<-colorQuantile(palette = "RdYlBu", domain=Detroit$MHV, n=10)
Dpalpop<-colorQuantile(palette = "RdBu", domain=Detroit$Totalpop, n=10)


### The Leaflet map
## Named map
## this will take awhile
Detmap<-Detroit %>% # Data set you want to map and the '%>%' is a piping command which makes it keep moving forward 
  st_transform(crs = "+init=epsg:4326") %>% # Setting the projection of our simple feature spatial dataframe to match the webmapping application
  leaflet() %>%  # Leaflet function which puts this all in motion
  setView(lng = -83.06, lat = 42.33, zoom = 8)%>% # the lng and lat set the center point, while zoom chooses how zoomed in it is
  addTiles(group = "OSM (default)") %>%  #This sets the base map and the following addProviderTiles() are optional otehr basemaps
  #addProviderTiles(providers$Stamen.TonerLite, group = "Toner Lite") %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron, group = "Carto B") %>%
  addPolygons(group = "Total", #Add polygons is how we choose what we want to map.
              popup = paste("Census Tract: ", Detroit$NAME, "<br>", #Pop up provides the pop up information if we were to click on the county, paste() pastes all the text together

            title="Percentile of Census Tract Total Population", group = "Total", opacity = 1) %>%

            title="Percentile of Census Tract Median Household Income", group = "MHV", opacity = 1) %>% 
  # Here we hide two of the groups so that only one shows on loading
  hideGroup("MHI") %>% # Hides the MHI layer so it doesn't all pop up at load
  hideGroup("MHV") %>% # Hides the MHV layer so it all doesn't pop up at the load
  addLayersControl(  #Gives you the option to turn on and off different basemaps or layers.

Detmap # loads the map you just made, this will take awhile

# Saving the Html map
# first argument is the leaflet map, second is the file name and extension, and final is whether it is selfcontained
# The space needed for the self contained file is a lot which is why we reduced it down to just one layer.
